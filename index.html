    <h1>Hi, I’m Free Hoebeke</h1>
    <p>I’m 27 years old and I've been living in Brussels for years. I met my girlfriend here and we are currently living in Jette, together with our 2 cats.</p>
    <p>The first time I had to think about a possible career as part of a school task, I already thought about coding.<br/>
      Unfortunately, at the age of 12 I still listened to my parents. So that same evening, my dad told me it wasn’t a good idea because coding could be too easily done abroad by cheaper workforce.<br/>
      From that moment on, I never thought about coding as a career possibility. Instead, for years, I followed some tutorials and started coding on my own on a very basic level, just for fun.
    </p>
    <p>Tired of only trying trough tutorials and thanks to a boring job, I finally took a big step forward and started coding lessons in 2019 at <a href="https://www.erasmushogeschool.be/nl/opleidingen/graduaat-programmeren">Erasmus Hogeschool Brussel</a> to give myself a last chance to prove that I could do something serious with coding. A Facebook ad and a pandemic later, and here I am, (soon) living my younger self’s dream!</p>
