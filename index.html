      <p>I’m 27 years old and  living in Jette (Brussels) with my girlfriend and our 2 cats.</p>
      <p>The first time I had to think about a possible career as part of a school task, I already thought about coding.<br/>
        Unfortunately, at the age of 12 I still listened to my parents. So that same evening, my dad told me it wasn’t a good idea because coding could be too easily done abroad by cheaper workforce.<br/>
        From that moment on, I never thought about coding as a career possibility. Instead, for years, I followed some tutorials and started coding on my own on a very basic level, just for fun.
      </p>
      <p>Tired of only trying trough tutorials and thanks to a boring job, I finally took a big step forward and started coding lessons in 2019 at <a href="https://www.erasmushogeschool.be/nl/opleidingen/graduaat-programmeren">Erasmus Hogeschool Brussel</a> to give myself a last chance to prove that I could do something serious with coding. A Facebook ad and a pandemic later, and here I am, (soon) living my younger self’s dream!</p>

      <h2>Other stuff</h2>

        <p>I started trading a couple of years ago. I would like to combine both my interest in trading and coding to create my own trading algorithms in the near future. With those algorithms I hope to improve my trading decisions which are still quiet poor at the moment.</p>
        <p>At EHB, we did a proof-of-concept on IOT with Arduino and I bougth my own Arduino starter kit recently to create a mini weather station. I'm not yet really into it, but the fact that my code can interact with the environment is already exciting enough.</p>
        <p>My first "professional" use of coding would be a VBA macro in Excel at my previous job. With that macro I changed a monthly 60 minute task into a 30 seconds task.</p>
        <p>Fun fact: Don't go to a (war) museum with me, I will read everything! 2 years ago, we visited Bastogne War Museum and my girlfriend was done nearly 2 hours earlier than me! and she had to wait of course...</p>
